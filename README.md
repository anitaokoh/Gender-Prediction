# Gender prediction App

This is web app powered by flask and Heroku  that predicts gender based on preference. The model that had the higher accuracy score was the CATboost model which was saved and used underneath the app to predict.


Due to the limited amount of dataset used to train, the model only has an accurracy score of 70% and it is very biased on certain preferences . For example, it associates cool colour to Male etc

Here is a demo of the app.

Further retraining will be done in the future as more data is accumulated.
